# I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. 
#All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

# Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

# To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

# The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (take_out)
# The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dine_in)
# Each customer order as it was finished by the kitchen. (served_orders)
# Given all three lists, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

# We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

# Check if we're serving orders first-come, first-served
